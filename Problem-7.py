# Problem 7: List Overlap (Medium)
# Write a function that takes two lists and returns a new list containing only the common elements.
# Each element in the result should appear only once.
# Example:
#   Input: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [3, 4, 5, 6]
#   Output: [3, 4]

def list_overlap(list1, list2):
    # TODO: Return the list of common elements between list1 and list2

# Test
print(list_overlap([1, 2, 3, 4], [3, 4, 5, 6]))  # Expected output: [3, 4]
